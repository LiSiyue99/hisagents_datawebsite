    "introContent": "HistBench is the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in historical reasoning. In the benchmark,two question types (exact match and multiple choice), six academic dimensions (e.g., source processing, interdisciplinary synthesis), and a three-tiered difficulty stratification based on task complexity are adopted. The benchmark contains 414 questions authored by more than 40 contributors, including Ph.D. students and domain experts. All questions are grounded in real historical sources and methods and follow a standardized protocol that ensures academic rigor and traceability. Each question is annotated with metadata including answer explanation,data required,source material, targeted capability, and thematic category and is subjected to a three-stage review: preliminary screening (format and semantic check), LLM-based pre-evaluation and professional review (history of rigor and validity of reasoning) to ensure the quality of these questions in terms of both form and content,especially their academic value and challenges to current LLMs.\nIn terms of coverage, HistBench spans 29 ancient and modern languages, over 20 historical regions, and at least 36 subfields. The questions are grounded in multimodal data, including printed texts, manuscripts, images, inscriptions, audio, and video. The benchmark also spans five major historical epoch, ranging from ancient history to the contemporary history, supporting diachronic analysis in diverse historiographic contexts. In all, these design criteria and dataset characteristics enable HistBench to serve as a robust diagnostic tool for evaluating LLMs in the humanities, with particular emphasis on capabilities of historical research like language mastery, historical materials processing and the understanding of historical analysis.",

    "level1_desc": "A total of 166 Level 1 questions are mainly formulated by research assistants with academic backgrounds in history. They are focused on extracting verifiable historical facts from historical materials or literature, interpreting well-documented primary sources to formulate questions. Tasks at this level emphasize factual investigation and basic material interpretation.",
    "level2_title": "Level 2 (Intermediate): Authored by Graduate Researchers and Domain Experts",
    "level2_desc": "The 172 Level 2 questions are mainly formulated by graduate students (MA and PhD level) and early-career researchers in history. Contributors are selected based on their specialization in particular subfields and are invited to design questions grounded in their areas of expertise. These tasks typically require source interpretation, basic causal or temporal research, and engagement with narrower but academically meaningful materials.",
    "level3_title": "Level 3 (Challenging): Authored by Professors and Senior Scholars",
    "level3_desc": "The 76 Level 3 questions are mainly contributed by senior scholars and university faculty with demonstrated experience in interpreting obscure sources, handling multi-lingual materials, and conducting interdisciplinary research. These tasks are designed to push the limits of LLM capabilities, drawing on rare texts, underdigitized archives, and cross-modal information integration.",
