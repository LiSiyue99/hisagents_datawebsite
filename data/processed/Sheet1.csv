313,"¿Por qué el Comisario Regio decide añadir una nota final comentando el tono de las anotaciones del Sr. Rueda en el expediente de cuentas del Jardín Zoológico?
A. Porque las observaciones del Sr. Rueda contradecían directamente las conclusiones legales del informe y debían ser anuladas formalmente.
B. Porque, a pesar de que los reparos contables eran menores, el tono de animosidad en las anotaciones comprometía la imagen de imparcialidad exigida en la administración pública.
C. Porque se descubrió que el Sr. Rueda tenía conflictos personales con el Director del Museo y el Comisario quiso reflejarlo oficialmente.
D. Porque el Comisario deseaba sancionar disciplinariamente al Sr. Rueda por haber retrasado la entrega de informes durante seis años.",2,multipleChoice,B,313_1.png;313_2.png,"En su resumen, señaló:
Aunque no es legal que los productos del zoológico no se hayan entregado a las autoridades fiscales, ya se ha obtenido la autorización de las autoridades competentes, por lo que es comprensible;
el retraso de seis años en la presentación de las cuentas constituye «morosidad excesiva», por lo que se debe aplicar una «suave corrección»;
los errores contables no son graves, «muy disculpables», debido a la falta de conocimientos contables del responsable, que solo contaba con la ayuda de un administrativo.
El comisario real reconoció en su valoración global que Graells había cometido irregularidades, pero también hizo una interpretación indulgente basándose en el contexto de la autorización y las condiciones reales. En este momento, si las críticas de Rueda se hubieran mantenido en el documento sin comentarios, los lectores podrían haber interpretado erróneamente que existían divergencias más intensas o hostiles dentro del sistema administrativo.
En otras palabras, no se trata de una negación de la postura de Rueda, sino de una crítica a su «tono y forma de expresión», especialmente en documentos como los de las finanzas públicas, que pueden dar lugar a interpretaciones políticas, donde un tono excesivo puede ser interpretado por el exterior como lucha partidista o inestabilidad institucional."

Reflecting on its situation, it identifies the origin of its positivity with a return — over and above all theory — to the modest but effecting level of the perceived. In fact, this supposed empiricism is not based on a rediscovery of the absolute values of the visible, nor on the predetermined rejection of systems and all their chimeras, but on a reorganization of that manifest and secret space that opened up when a millennial gaze paused over men's sufferings. Nonetheless the rejuvenation of medical perception, the way colours and things came to life underthe illuminating gaze of the first clinicians is no mere myth. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, doctors described what for centuries had remained below the threshold of the visible and the expressible, but this did not mean that, after over-indulging inspeculation, they had begun to perceive once again, or that they listened to reason rather than to imagination; it meant that the relation between the visible and invisible-which is necessary to all concrete knowledge-changed its structure, revealing through gaze and language what had previously been below and beyond their domain. A new alliance was forged between words and things, enabling one to see and to say. Sometimes, indeed, the discourse was so completely ‘naive’ that it seems to belong to a more archaic level of rationality, as if it involved a return to the clear, innocent gaze of some earlier, golden age.”"

Г. Демографическая катастрофа случилась именно в селах. Миграционная активность населения в 1933 г. была низкой, были запреты на выезд населения. Голод явился причиной массовых миграций местного населения в города.",3,multipleChoice,А,,"Такое большое число умерших не местных указывает и на то, что описываемые в работах по голоду 1932–1933 гг. запреты на выезд населения преувеличены, а миграционная активность населения в 1933 г. была очень высокой. Анализ величин смертности по национальным районам Крыма не показывает никакого украинского или какоголибо иного национального «гено цида голодом» в Крыму. Смертность в украинском национальном Ишуньском районе была одинаковой со смертностью в еврейском национальном Фрай дорфском районе и меньше смертности в некоторых русских национальных районах Крыма. Также нет социальной компоненты голода («крестьяноцид») — сельское население Крыма характеризуется достаточно высоким естественным приростом. Самый низкий прирост был в Ялтинском районе и пригородной сельской местности Керчи и Симферополя, где в наибольшей степени постра дало городское население. В целом села Крыма перенесли 1933 г. без демо графической катастрофы, сопровождающейся резким падением естественного прироста населения.
Кроме того, смертность (которая должна расти при падении уровня жизни) до 1931 г. в Крыму не менялась, колеблясь в пределах чуть выше 11 тыс. чел. То есть в случае Крыма наиболее вероятные причины падения рождаемости были связаны с такими социальными преобразованиями, как эмансипация женщин, рост грамотности, распад религиозных семейных и социальных традиций в результате антирелигиозной пропаганды и легализация абортов.51 Также, возможно, в крымских национальных районах традиционный уклад жизни держался гораздо дольше, что и обусловило такой плавный и замедленный демографический переход. И в 1932 г. рождаемость стала расти, что никак не сообразуется с «голодомором» 1932 г. Упала рождаемость только в 1933– 1934 гг., после чего скачком в 1935 г. вышла на уровень конца 1920х гг.
Таким образом, крымская система загсов в городах в целом справлялась с текущим учетом естественного движения населения, в том числе и приезжих мигрантов. Неполноты охвата или недоучета населения в городах по архивным документам не выявлено. Также не выявлено намеренного сокрытия смертей. Однако на селе загсы работали хуже, в результате чего 23 % населения в ито говую статистику рождаемости и смертности не попало. В связи с этим офици альные показатели рождаемости и смертности в селах Крыма и естественный прирост сельского населения являются заниженными. "

46,Who among the following is closer to Michel Foucault’s understanding of paradigm/exemplum? A. Karl Popper B. Thomas Kuhn C. Plato D. Gilbert Simondon E. Socrates,2,multipleChoice,C,,"Thomas Kuhn’s concept of paradigm is about disciplinary matrix or examples universally recognized by scientific achievements that, for a time, provide model problems and solutions for a community of researchers, while Michel Foucault’s understanding of paradigm is related to the episteme(s)  implicating “rules of formation” which govern what constitutes legitimate forms of knowledge for a particular cultural period. The latter one shows affinities to Plato’s use of paradigm in his dialectic. For other options, Kuhn’s theory in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions challenged Karl Popper’s opinions with progressivism in science, both Gilbert Simondon and Foucault were inspired by their teacher Georges Canguilhem but diverged their approaches to the philosophy of science and technology, and Plato composed his philosophical dialogues assuming the role of his teacher Socrates."

Содержание: «Литва пошла войной на карел»
Перевод: Литва пошла войной на карел.
Это военно-политическое донесение. Как и другие подобные донесения, оно не имеет адресной формулы; это явно связано с необходимостью конспирации.
Помимо текста, грамота содержит большой тамгообразный знак; быть может, это личный знак, заменяющий имя автора-лазутчика.
К сожалению, при первоначальной датировке грамоты No 590, основанной на полевой оценке, была допущена серьезная ошибка, которая проникла и в издание (где грамота отнесена к концу XII в.). Ошибка была исправлена в ходе итогового стратиграфического анализа всей совокупности находок Нутного раскопа, проведенного П. Г. Гайдуковым (см. Гайдуков 1992: 81).
По предположению В. Л. Янина (1998: 265-266), грамота относится к 1069 г., когда полоцкий князь Всеслав Брячиславич предпринял поход на Новгород через водскую землю, где и могло произойти столкновение сопровождающих князя литовцев с карелами."

Масленица — это праздник, знаменующий проводы зимы и встречу весны. Изначально он имеет древние языческие корни, связанные с днем весеннего равноденствия 20 марта. С приходом христианства дата Масленицы стала зависеть от начала Великого поста и Пасхи и выпадать на первую неделю поста. В православной традиции эту неделю называют Сырной седмицей, когда уже нельзя есть мясо, но разрешены молочные продукты. Последний день, когда можно было есть мясо, — это Мясопуст, воскресенье перед Масленицей.
Масленицу часто сравнивают с русским карнавалом. Похожие праздники есть и в других странах: например, Mardi Gras во Франции или Shrove Tuesday в Великобритании.
Главный символ Масленицы — блины, которые ассоциируются с солнцем и поминанием предков, согласно поверьям, помогающим с будущим урожаем. Кроме блинов, готовили лепешки, вареники и «жаворонков» из ржаной муки. Также популярной традицией была братчина — совместное пивоварение и распитие пива всей деревней. "

Peiping, February 17, 1933—11 p.m.
[Received February 18—3:20 a.m.]
159. My 125, February 7, noon [11 a.m.]. I have now received from Nanking a note from the Minister of Foreign Affairs dated February 13 accompanied by a translation the substance of which is as follows:
“The National Government by great efforts succeeded in balancing its budget during 1932 without recourse to borrowing; particulars as to how this was accomplished together with a full statement of the financial situation are contained in the report of the Minister of Finance dated December 15, 1932. Reduction of military expenditures and conversion of the loans were major factors in making possible the success of the National Government in this regard but the postponement of the American and British portions of the indemnity thereby reducing expenditures by almost $20,000,000 annually was likewise essential in making possible a balanced budget.

The difficulty of stabilizing the national finances has been greatly increased due to the reduction of customs revenues in the past year by about 25 percent. This reduction has resulted from the worldwide depression and from the Japanese seizure of the entire revenues of Manchuria thereby throwing upon the rest of the country the entire burden of loan and indemnity service. Unhappily these conditions still continue.

The National Government can scarcely go further in increasing revenue or curtailing expenditure. To resume indemnity payments at once in accordance with the schedule would disturb the financial equilibrium just attained with such difficulty.

The National Government appreciates fully the undertaking given that the present postponement does not constitute a precedent for [Page 663]the future. In existing difficult conditions however the National Government feels that it has no option but to seek a temporary continuation of the existing arrangement. The National Government being fully aware that activities are currently proceeding which are dependent for support upon indemnity payments would of course undertake to make arrangements with the agencies concerned for the support of these activities early in coming year.

This division of labor was captured most famously in the portrait that adorns the last page of Fuchs's De historia stirpium (1542; fig. 1.14). Two craftsmen are called painters (pictores); Albrecht Meyer is shown drawing the picture of a plant and Heinrich Fiüllmaurer is seen transferring the drawings onto the woodblocks; Veit Rudolf Specklin, who cut those woodblocks, is shown below as the cutter (sculptor). We should not, however, take this portrait too liter-d ally, since we know from the surviving drawings for De historia stirpium in the Austrian National Library that both Füllmaurer and Meyer drew the original sketches and probably both did the tracing.66 What neither did was the cutting of the woodblocks. Specklin (d. 1550), the block-cutter, was active in Strasbourg and may have cut woodcuts for other printed books, for instance those for the Bible (1531) for the Zurich printer Christoph Froschauer. It is unclear, however, when or where Specklin cut the woodblocks for Fuchs.
In the preface to his book, Fuchs wrote: ""The block cutter [ sculptor] Veit Rudolf Specklin, by far the best in Strasbourg, excellently imitated the admi-rable industry of painters: he has so skilfully expressed the outlines of each picture by carving (sculpendo) that he seems to compete with the painter for glory and victory.""69 A comparison between the painter and the sculptor was a favorite topic in the Renaissance genre of paragone, a competition between the arts; Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarotti (1475-1564), and Galileo Galilei all composed treatises in which the relative merits of various mimetic arts were discussed.7o Fuchs's comment on Specklin is a little more nuanced."

Since the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians have attached great importance to the making of mummies.

The sickle-shaped knife shown in the picture is one of the ritual implements used in the ""opening"" ceremony. On the one hand, the opening ceremony can enable all organs to resume their functions and ensure that the deceased's life in the afterlife is normal. On the other hand, this ritual implement may be the same tool as the one used to cut the umbilical cord of newborns, thereby strengthening the theme of rebirth.It is noteworthy that the heart is the sole internal organ that has been retained. The act of burying the deceased along with their belongings, which symbolizes their life during their lifetime, was a prevalent practice in ancient China, particularly during the Han Dynasty when there was a conviction that ""treat the deceased as if the deceased were still alive""."

C.Such a statement would significantly damage UK-Turkey relations.D.His identity as a democratic leader compelled him to adopt measured and prudent rhetoric.,3,multipleChoice,D,385.png,"At the time, the issue of Turkey's accession to the EU was raised by the Brexit camp and became a dominant topic in the public discourse for a period. Lindsey's research shows that after Cameron responded to the issue by stating, 'There is no prospect of Turkey joining the EU in decades,' UK-Turkey relations had already been severely damaged. Under such circumstances, a straightforward further declaration that 'Turkey will not join the EU' would have had a tangible positive impact on the battle for public opinion and alleviating public concerns. However, Cameron chose not to do so. Here, we need to introduce some theoretical perspectives. Cain's research suggests that leaders in democratic countries tend to 'employ a tone of soberness and prudence that reveals a central concern for ordinary people.' This habitual approach led Cameron to think more from his position as prime minister, opting for a more cautious statement—a point that is also corroborated in his memoirs.(A)Persuasion is vital to the practice of democratic leadership, making speech and communication of fundamental importance. Yet, democratic citizens habitually suspect political rhetoric as being either deceitfully empty or dangerously subversive. Rhetoric is thus central in democracy while paradoxically appearing either useless or pernicious. A consequence of this paradox for democratic leaders is that they are forced to avoid fine oratory in favour of a rhetorical style that sounds un-rhetorical, seeming to be plain factually-informative speech. This unique democratic form of rhetoric, which we have called an artless art, seeks to instil trust and to avoid appearing to talk down to the sovereign people.(B)Once again, Cameron 
strongly repudiated all these claims: ‘There is no prospect of Turkey joining the EU in 
decades. You cannot find an expert on this subject – you’ve been quoting lots of experts 
– you cannot find one, because it’s not going to happen.’
103
Up until this point, Turkey, like many other EU members and candidate countries, had 
steered clear of becoming involved in the referendum debate. However, the 
increasingly strong tone taken by the sides now forced it to respond. Mevlüt Çavasoğlu, 
the Turkish Foreign Minister, argued that it was not ‘right’ that Turkish membership 
had become a central issue in the campaign. His country had never been a ‘burden’ on 
the EU.104 Others in Turkey were far more scathing. Speaking on the BBC, Ilnur Çevik, 
President Erdoğan’s chief adviser, said that his country had been ‘flabbergasted’ by 
Britain’s stand. Noting that the Turkish Government had thought that the prime ministerwas its ‘chief supporter’ in its quest for EU membership, he said that Turkey now felt 
‘taken in’ by his stance. As he explained, ‘the way [Cameron is] putting it, “they were 
never going to get in anyway, we just said we’ll go along with them”, that kind of 
attitude is deeply hurting the Turks…it is very insincere.’ As for the claims that millions 
of Turkish citizens would try to enter the UK after accession, he repudiated these by 
asking, ‘why should we be flooding Britain? There’s no reason. Whatever exists in 
Britain also exists in Turkey. We’re not going to go there just because you produce 
Cadbury’s chocolate and Maltesers.’105 Meanwhile, on the day before the referendum, 
President Erdoğan even waded into the debate, albeit indirectly. Launching a scathing 
attack on the way in which the EU was treating Turkey, and accusing it of not wanting 
a ‘Muslim-majority country’, he even suggested that Turkey might consider holding its 
own referendum on whether to continue EU accession talks.

56,"In the book Picturing the Book of Nature: Image, Text, and Argument in Sixteenth-Century Human Anatomy and Medical Botany, what artistic style does the author attribute to this image ?",2,exactMatch,Naturalism,056.png,"Albrecht Dürer, Large Piece of Turf (1503)


Roughly contemporary to Leonardo's anatomical sketch is a watercolor  by Albrecht Durer (1471 - 1528), commonly known as the Large Piece of Turf (1503). As Karen Reeds observed, ""The plants are observed from the vantage point of, say, a hare, close to the ground, peering upward at the tallest grasses. The botanical clarity of the scene is enhanced by what is not there: Durer had tidied away the usual litter of dead grasses, leaves, and moss. The muddy ground from which the plants spring is rendered with a loose wash that makes the controlled brush and pen lines of the plants stand out all the more distinctly. Using a technique found in his woodcuts and etchings, Durer models each plant in its own shadows - none casts a shadow on any other, even where the low sunlight catches the rosette of the unfolding plantain. The clarity of the composition and the perfection of each plant within it support the argument... that Neo Platonism had strongly influenced Durer's vision.""

Durer's sketch shares with Leonardo the technique of ""hyperrealism"" by emphasizing key features and selecting out potential optical confusions. Such a selection, in Durer's case, was directed by a sense of something beyond appearances in nature, as he believed that a good painter should render visible the Platonic idea latent in his mind. Durer also had an interest in understanding the patterns underlying the workings of nature; he studied proportional relations in the human body, and sought to put the artist's craft on a more certain foundation in geometry.

Leonardo and Durer were superb masters of ""naturalistic"" techniques that could be deployed for various purposes; they were curious about the principles underlying nature, and they sought to establish art on a more generalized footing. In short, these were skilled and informed draftsmen of nature, but neither their techniques nor their subject matter (the human body and plants) guaranteed that the object depicted was observed directly and represented faithfully, or that the pictured object existed at all. It would simply be unwise to presume that ""naturalistic"" pictures are transparent windows onto nature and natural objects of the past. They are not the premodern equivalents of photographic shots of actual, individual specimens, which record specific moments and accidental details like torn leaves, bent stems, grit or dirt, without correction or omission.

371,"You are presented with an image of a 3rd century BCE statue made of marble, depicting a ruler in royal attire. What cultural and political significance can be inferred from the statue’s design, materials, and iconography, considering the historical context of the era? (If more than one answer, select more than one)             A. The ruler’s divine right to rule: The regal posture, intricate crown, and scepter suggest the ruler’s divine mandate and the belief in the ruler’s connection to the gods, reinforcing the divine right theory that was central to monarchies during the era.

B. A symbol of military conquest: The ruler’s detailed armor and military stance suggest their power came from military conquest, likely symbolizing strength and dominance over neighboring territories.

C. A representation of cultural fusion between Greek and local artistic traditions: The design incorporates both Hellenistic Greek and local artistic styles, reflecting the era’s political strategy of cultural unification to consolidate control over diverse regions.

D. The ruler as a religious leader, rather than just a political figure: The use of divine symbols and ceremonial attire suggests the ruler’s role as a religious figure, merging the political and spiritual leadership of the region.
",3,multipleChoice,AC,371.png,"Why A and C are the correct answers:
 • A. The ruler’s divine right to rule:
 • Explanation: The statue, with its regal posture, intricate crown, and scepter, symbolizes the ruler’s divine right to govern, which is a common concept in monarchies of ancient times. The depiction suggests that the ruler’s authority is divinely ordained, a political belief central to many ancient civilizations. This aligns with the iconography of rulers who were seen not only as political figures but also as divine or semi-divine beings with the mandate to rule.
 • C. A representation of cultural fusion between Greek and local artistic traditions:
 • Explanation: The design of the statue incorporates both Hellenistic Greek and local artistic styles, which reflects the blending of cultures. During the Hellenistic period, many regions were influenced by Greek culture, and this fusion in art and architecture was a common political strategy to consolidate power and unify diverse peoples under a single ruler. The statue’s design indicates an effort to combine Greek and local traditions, showcasing cultural integration for political purposes.

Why B and D are incorrect:
 • B. A symbol of military conquest:
 • Explanation: This option focuses on the statue’s armor and military stance, suggesting the ruler gained power through military conquest. However, the statue’s design emphasizes political and religious power through the crown and scepter, which are symbols of sovereignty and divine rule rather than military dominance. While the ruler may have been a military leader, the statue itself is more focused on the political and divine authority, not military conquest. Hence, B does not accurately reflect the main message of the statue.
 • D. The ruler as a religious leader, rather than just a political figure:
 • Explanation: While the statue may have some religious symbolism, such as the crown, it primarily emphasizes the ruler’s political and divine authority, not solely religious leadership. The figure depicted in the statue is likely a political leader with a divine mandate to rule, rather than a religious leader. Therefore, D overemphasizes the religious aspect, ignoring the political and cultural significance that the statue also conveys. The statue reflects the fusion of both political and religious aspects, not just one."

He not only had a good relationsnhip with Bahrām Mīrzā, the Shāh's brother, but he also accumulated a lot of wealth through his position as governor of Fārs. The Shāh had already concerned about his influence in the Safavid political system, while Ibrāhīm Khān was so ambbitious that he wanted to consolidate his autority in the Fārs region and acted as a local Shāh. This was a situation that the Shāh could not tolerate. The Shāh was waiting for an opportunity to depose him from the governorship. In 1555AD/ 962AH, the opportunity came.

The trigger that prompted the Nationalist Government to accelerate the process of recovering the waterway rights was the December 8th Incident in Shanghai. During this process, the Navy Department of the Nationalist Government played an important role in training waterway workers and other aspects. The Japanese Navy Department and the General Staff Department also deeply participated in this diplomatic negotiation. Additionally, among various demands from Japan, it can be found that Japan has never given up the option of freely hiring waterway workers in order to obtain the right to ships entering and leaving ports, especially in the issue of military ships' access during the war."

按《明太宗实录》，永乐三年（1405）九月丙申“升山西道监察御史周新为云南按察使”，永乐六年（1408）三月庚申“改河南布政司左参议易英、云南按察使周新皆于浙江”，周新实赴云南按察使之任。又西平侯沐晟彼时镇守云南，其弟昂协助理政。沐昂与众多云南官员有交往，其《素轩集》收录赠周新任满回京之诗《送周宪使》，是为周新任职云南之旁证（沐昂《素轩集》卷三，收《明别集丛刊》第1辑第34册，黄山：黄山书社，2013年，页32）。

检国图藏三一三卷本《明史纪传》、四一六卷本《明史》之周新本传，均记周氏“还朝，即擢为云南按察使，久之，改浙江”（《明史纪传》卷八四，北京国家图书馆藏钞本，页3a；〔旧题〕万斯同《明史》卷二〇六，收《续修四库全书》，史部第67册，页570），大致无误。然王鸿绪雍正元年进呈本《明史稿》，误改为“还朝，即擢云南按察使，未赴，改浙江”（王鸿绪《明史稿》，《列传》卷四二，台北：文海出版社，页380），遂与史实乖离。

王鸿绪之误改，应是受《国朝献征录》所收黄佐《周志新传》误导（焦竑《国朝献征录》卷八四《周志新传》，上海：上海书店出版社，1987年，页3565）。黄佐作此传，“用彭森所撰《传》、《水东日记》、《广州志》、《松江志》参修”，称周氏“擢云南按察使，未赴，有旨改浙江。”（黄佐《广州人物传》卷一四，收《四库全书存目丛书》，史部第90册，济南：齐鲁书社，1997年，页522、524）彭森《传》为黄《传》史源之一，检彭《传》，即称周新“已而擢云南按察使，未及莅政，有命转浙江。”（徐纮《皇明名臣琬琰录》卷一九《冷面寒铁公传》，收《原北平图书馆甲库善本丛书》第241册，北京：国家图书馆出版社，2013年，页1047）。由是，可厘清黄《传》、王《传》致误之由。而殿本《明史·周新传》之误，是承袭王鸿绪本而来。"

В статье рассматриваются основные факторы развития золотодобывающего комплекса Дальстроя после создания в декабре 1953 г. Магаданской области. Причинами кризисных явленийв золотодобыче Дальстроя с конца 1940-х гг. были многие факторы, в том числе снижение обеспеченности запасами россыпного золота, уменьшение среднего содержания золота в песках, дефицит квалифицированных кадров, проблемы организации принудительного труда, а также управленческие решения, определившие сосредоточение поисковых работ на золоторудных месторождениях в пределах Колымской золотоносной зоны и переориентацию Дальстроя преимущественно на разведку и добычу олова. Одной из главных причин кризиса золотодобычи после 1953 г. являлся перевод всей производственной системы организации на свободный труд. Процесс трансформации экономической модели сопровождался проблемами организации свободного и принудительного труда, высокой текучестью кадров, необходимостью подбора квалифицированного персонала для обслуживания бульдозеров, экскаваторов и промывочных приборов, размещения, благоустройства и создания условий для гражданских работников, в том числе бывших спецпоселенцев, а также обеспечения работы с заключенными на новых договорных условиях. Численность работников золотодобывающей промышленности за 1953-1957 гг. сократилась более чем в два с половиной раза. Руководство региона, сохраняя систему льгот и опираясь на отработанные схемы (оргнабор, общественный призыв) и административные ресурсы, пыталось заместить персонал. Использование принудительного труда заключенных против привлечения «вольнонаемных» работников на золотодобыче Северо-Востока в 1950-е гг. уже не было обусловлено экономическим расчетом в сравнении с периодом 1930-х - первой половины 1940-х гг. В 1950-е гг. вместе с уменьшением объемов ручной работы, ростом механизации и автоматизации труд заключенных становился все более затратным и менее эффективным."

Woo Pun, aged 41, a shoemaker of Pwanyü, have been afflicted with a large unshapen tumor upon the left side of his neck. It hung pendulous from the submaxilliary, extending backward over the external jugular vein and carotid artery, forwards to the opposite side of the trachea and downwards to the breast. For the last ten years its growth was rapid, and from its magnitude it had become very cumbersome. It was as large as the man’s head, and so hard as not to yield to the pressure of the thumb. Centrally it was diseased and having perforated by an escharotics of an Chinese practitioner, it emitted a most offensive discharge. The aperture was half an inch in diameter and as regular as if formed by a drill. The patient kept it closed with a stopple, every morning evacuating some ounces of offensive fluid. His constitution had begun to suffer. On the 19th June, assisted by Messrs Cox, Cullen and Jardine, the tumor was removed in about five minutes. Several veins of considerable size were divided. (...) The tumor was two feet in circumference and weighed 7 lbs. The patient scarce uttered a groan. In twenty minutes he was comfortable in bed. (...) At 1 o’clock A.M. a servant called; and when I arrived at the hospital, the poor man was apparently gasping his last. He was very bloody and evidently made a desperate struggle without success to loosen the bandage. The neck was instantly freed of the roller. His pulse was just perceptible, his extremities were already cold; he foamed at the nose, and breathed stertorously, as in apoplexy. His mouth was immediately freed of phlegm, and his nose of blood; stimulants were applied, and also administered internally, and bottles of warm water put to his feet. (...) Probably the brother [his brother?] fell asleep and awoke only by the almost dying struggle of the patient. Two or three minutes delay in coming to his relief might have been too late! (...) In one month he was perfectly recovered. He has repeatedly visited the hospital. His constitution was wonderfully recovered and from the inroads of the disease and he again enjoys excellent health, and evinced unbound gratitude. He sees to regard the favor received, as conferring on him full liberty to introduce and all his diseased friends. This is very uniformly the case with such as have received any special benefit.

57,Which book does this illustration come from?,2,exactMatch,De Historia Stirpium ,057.png," De Historia Stirpium is part of a long tradition of herbals, or books that describe plants and their medicinal uses. Before the sixteenth century, most herbals were based on folk traditions and Greek and Roman texts, not on scientific or artistic observation. Leonhart Fuchs broke with tradition by becoming interested in illustrating plants as they looked in nature instead of using conventional (and often bizarrely inaccurate) representations. Fuchs hired three professional artists to help him with this undertaking: Albrecht Meyer, who drew the plants from life; Heinrich Füllmaurer, who transferred the line drawings to woodblocks; and Vitus Rudolph Speckle, who cut the blocks and printed the woodcut illustrations. The beautiful, densely illustrated book that resulted from their efforts contains some of the finest pictures of plants in the sixteenth century, many hand-colored under Fuchs’ supervision for the greatest accuracy. De Historia Stirpium is notable among early scientific books for its inclusion of the artists’ names and portraits in the back of the book.

Fuchs’ interest in realistic representations accorded with the Renaissance ideal of naturalism, but it also served a practical purpose – he wanted his book to be a reference for his medical students and fellow doctors. While the images were cutting-edge for their time, Fuchs was not as revolutionary in the text, and his descriptions of each plant’s medicinal properties still draw largely on the writings of Greek and Roman authors such as Dioscorides, Galen and Pliny. Even so, Fuchs did encourage his own students to cultivate and study medicinal plants firsthand. Surviving copies of De Historia Stirpium often contain pressed plant samples, stains, and marginal notes that point to extensive use, and the copy belonging to Special Collections is no exception. In this way, De Historia Stirpium can give modern scholars insight into the ways early physicians studied and administered herbal medicines.

De Historia Stirpium was more than a lavishly illustrated compendium of remedies. The book also introduced many Europeans to the unfamiliar fruits, vegetables and plants being imported from the Americas. De Historia Stirpium contains the first description and illustration of over 100 species of plants, including pumpkins, squash, chili peppers, and maize, although some species are misidentified. It is thought that some of these plants were drawn from specimens or seeds Fuchs acquired and grew in his own garden."

The Hortus botanicus Leiden was founded in 1590, making it the oldest botanical garden in western Europe. Its establishment was closely tied to the founding of the University of Leiden in 1575. At that time, the university's board sought to create a ""hortus medicus,"" or medical herb garden, to support the education of medical students by providing access to plants used in pharmacology. This practical need drove the creation of the Hortus. The founding of both the university and the garden occurred during the Renaissance, a period of intellectual and scientific renewal in Europe. The Renaissance had fostered advancements in many fields, including medicine and botany, which aligned with the university's academic goals. Over time, the Hortus expanded its collection and influence, growing into the four-acre garden it is today."

Lluís Borrassà, the second son of the painter Guillem Borrassà, was part of a family of painters from Girona which worked in this country from the mid-14th century until the mid-15th century. There is documentary evidence that in 1383 Lluís Borrassà's painting workshop was open in the city of Barcelona, soon to become one of the largest workshops in the city, where numerous artists, helpers and collaborators worked. His arrival in Barcelona coincided with the moment when the Italianate Gothic style, prevalent in this country throughout the second half of the 14th century, whose chief disseminator had been the Serra brothers' workshop, was exhausted and going into decline. The new International Gothic art that in those years was beginning to be produced in Flanders, Paris or Milan was characterised by leaving behind the balance and the sober harmony of the shapes and the colours, made fashionable by the artists from Siena of the 'trecento', in order to introduce a new naturalistic aesthetic based on the dynamism and the movement of the figures and the use of very bright and contrasting coloured pigments. The Episcopal Museum conserves possibly the most representative collection of work by Lluís Borrassà, through which we can follow the introduction and development of this new artistic current in his work. The altarpiece of Saint Anthony the Abbot and Saint Margaret from Rubió, despite being a modestly sized altarpiece, introduces in the lateral scenes this new narrative language based on very explicit gestures like the scene of the saint's dialogue, refusing Olybrius' advances."

In view of this, it is noteworthy that an envisaged connection between the eyes and the optical device was present in some of the earliest Japanese writings about the magic lantern. Through looking at the language and context of these references, it becomes apparent that Ōtsuki's conception of the device ‘as an eyeball’, and by extension the eyeball as a magic lantern, was not an entirely original idea, but rather the evolution of a pre-existing one. One of the two oldest surviving references to the device in Japanese—the other being Koikawa Harumachi's aforementioned Muda iki—is the three-volume book of magic tricks, Tengu-tsu (‘The Goblin's Nose’), published in Osaka in 1779 by the prolific chronicler of magic tricks, Hirase Hose."

The virus works by partially and irregularly suppressing the anthocyanin, thereby allowing a portion of the underlying color to show through. It wasn’t until the 1920s, after the invention of the electron microscope, that scientists discovered the virus was being spread from tulip to tulip by Myzus persicae, the peach potato aphid. Peach trees were a common feature of seventeenth-century gardens.

By the 1920s the Dutch regarded their tulips as commodities to trade rather than jewels to display, and since the virus weakened the bulbs it infected (the reason the offsets of broken tulips were so small and few in number), Dutch growers set about ridding their fields of the infection. Color breaks, when they did occur, were promptly destroyed, and a certain peculiar manifestation of natural beauty abruptly lost its claim on human affection."""
